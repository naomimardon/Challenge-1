# Challenge-1


## Description 

A marketing agency requires their site to be refactored to make it more accessible. In particular, it should meet the following standards:

    * Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
    * HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    * Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
    * Heading attributes fall in sequential order
    * Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

The CSS has also been reworked to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
